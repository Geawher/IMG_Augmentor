# IMG_Augmentor
## About TunAugmentor
The aim of this project was to reimplement different image augmentation techniques using only Python and Numpy. We do not claim we reinvented the wheel. We know theese techniques are already available in different libraries with better implementations and you should probably use theese instead. The goal was to learn to implement this techniques and to try to distribute a Python Library. Thus, we didn't do any benchmarking for this work.
Albumentations was a great source of inspiration concerning which transformation to implement and for the documentation. Try to check their work you may find what you really need.
